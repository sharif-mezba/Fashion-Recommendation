Dataset download link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=1

# About the project :

1. Extracted features from the images using the ResNet50 transfer learning model.

2. K Nearest Neighbor algorithm is used to find the similar and recommend images for any given input image.

3. Used Streamlit library to make a user interactive web app.

# How to run:

1.Download the repo.

2.Create a project in any editor and paste all the repo file to the project folder.

3.Download the dataset and put it to the project folder(Specially images folder).

4.Run the model_building.py file 

5.Then run test.py file for recommendation items testing.

6.Finally run the app.py file by this command : streamlit run app.py (command should be wrote on the terminal of the editor)
